To run a Java class file from the `./target/classes/org/example` directory, you have several options depending on your setup:

## Method 1: Using java command with classpath

```bash
# From the project root directory
java -cp ./target/classes org.example.YourClassName
```

## Method 2: Navigate to the classes directory

```bash
# Navigate to the classes directory
cd ./target/classes

# Then run from there
java org.example.YourClassName
```

## Method 3: If you have a main class with package declaration

Make sure your class has the correct package declaration and main method:

```java
package org.example;

public class YourClassName {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

## Method 4: Using Maven (if you built with Maven)

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.YourClassName"
```

## Method 5: If you have dependencies

If your class has external dependencies, you'll need to include them in the classpath:

```bash
java -cp "./target/classes:./target/dependency/*" org.example.YourClassName
```

## Example:
Assuming you have a class called `Main` in the `org.example` package:

```bash
# From project root
java -cp ./target/classes org.example.Main
```

Replace `YourClassName` with the actual name of your class file (without the `.class` extension). Make sure the class has a `public static void main(String[] args)` method to be executable.
