# To create uv project, what is the difference between "uv init" and "uv venv"?


In the context of the `uv` package manager for Python (from Astral, formerly known as `rye`), the difference between `uv init` and `uv venv` is in their purpose and behavior when setting up a Python project.

---

### ✅ `uv init`

* **Purpose**: Initializes a new Python project.
* **What it does**:

  * Creates a `pyproject.toml` file (for project metadata and dependencies).
  * Optionally creates a virtual environment.
  * Installs project dependencies (if any).
  * Optionally sets up a source control ignore file like `.gitignore`.
* **Typical usage**:

  ```bash
  uv init
  ```

  You'll be prompted for project name, Python version, and other settings.

> Think of `uv init` as a full project scaffolding tool.

---

### ✅ `uv venv`

* **Purpose**: Creates a standalone virtual environment in the current directory.
* **What it does**:

  * Sets up a virtual environment (like `python -m venv`).
  * Does *not* create a `pyproject.toml` or any other project scaffolding.
* **Typical usage**:

  ```bash
  uv venv
  ```

  Creates a `.venv` folder in the current directory.

> Think of `uv venv` as just creating a virtual environment without touching anything else.

### Summary:

| Command   | Sets up project files (`pyproject.toml`) | Creates virtual environment | Installs dependencies | Interactive setup |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| `uv init` | ✅ Yes                                    | ✅ Yes (optional)            | ✅ Yes                 | ✅ Yes             |
| `uv venv` | ❌ No                                     | ✅ Yes                       | ❌ No                  | ❌ No              |
